# CropPredict

This project predicts wheat yields based on location and weather data. It is inspired by [this](https://github.com/aerialintel/data-science-exercise) data science challenge.

This repository includes several jupyter notebooks that contain all the code for data exploration, manipulation and training of a supervised machine-learning model.
